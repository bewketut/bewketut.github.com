<h2>In Short</h2>
<p class="intro">
<em>Graduated in Telecommunications Engineer from <a href='http://www.unsw.edu.au'>UNSW</a>. I have been involved with extensive area of developement from kernel-level programming to application layer during my study years and after</em> although the previledges that come with education have been denied to me by the Australian government in denying me entry visa. Even after ALL my effort (financial and other) have been spent there. A graduate in one system is like a tourist to another system. I have been rendered a tourist in my own country Ethiopia because its education doesn't map to Australia nor there is as much opportunity. Education was ideally a recommendation to all. But it is a regret in my case. Survival comes ahead.

	<h2> Philosophy</h2>
	<p> I try to follow the UNIX philosophy of  <em> KISS</em> as outlined by Eric Raymond, enjoy originally written minimalistic softwares (dia, grep, vi (!emacs), C) but also have developed a taste for integration of various software solutions specifically while working with CMSs. I like to tap into the power of opensource software community but also provide back crashdumps, bug reports and various areas of testing and providing my system information, participating in forums and do aim to provide tutorials on project files- in the area of latex- that I have worked on and continue to work on.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
    I have been programming in C, Java, PHP, and even was writing wrappers for SQL queries. And in the area of Telecommunications, networking is my expertise, translating lengthy RFCs into codes- mainly using C- and have spent much of my time on the Network Layer. My encounter to CMSs have introduced to providing quick solutions via integration of plugins, practical aspect of SEO and understaning part of the Business logic of applications. I am also very familiar with both analog and digital circuit design and engineering design lifecycle (cf. SDLC) to create a desired commercial product.
    I am firmly grounded on Unix OS terminal and Vi. However, I have to jump to Windows every now and then when the need arises to either <em>use Office </em>. I <em>configure *nix systems</em> when the need arises. I speak Amharic, English and basic skills in both Arabic and German.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>For more than <abbr class="duration">2 years</abbr> I <em>studied at <a href="http://www.dillauniversity.edu.et" class="url summary">Dilla University</a></em> in Ethiopia pursuing a degree in Physics. I left after two and half-years. In the meantime, I applied to the Univeristy of New South Wales and was offered a place where I <em>graduated as a telecom. engineer</em>. During this time, most of my time did cross over to the computer sciences field where I studied<em> computer-science related subjects like Database Systems, Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence and in putting effort to translate those courses to the network layer or layer 3 </em>. I have applied most of those skills I have in writing my final year thesis  and wrote a <em> code for a dynamic multicast firewall filter</em>  which tries to block unwanted users coming into a multicast group they are not invited to <a href="http://www.ee.unsw.edu.au/~vijay/pubs/conf/icc07.pdf">'on the fly'</a>. As a student, I was more worried about building it and allowed the user to make that decision- making it fully dynamic, boom- and only wondered about the implication later on- like allowing a user to join mutually exclusive multicast groups-which can raise theoretical-only questions.
