<h2>In Short</h2>
<p class="intro">
<em>As a recent graduate programmer and traditional Telecommunications Engineer, I have been involved with extensive area of developement from kernel-level programming to the application layer</em>. In doing so, I have been previledged to traverse TCP/IP model and the 7-OSI Layers resepectively.
The last year, that is, since I finished my University degree, I have mainly focused on the top layer IP stack both as a form of break from University and Lower level programming- specifically content management systems, databases and web programming. 
While my visa application is being processed (visa subclass 885), I would want to get a technical assistant position in the areas of my field of expertise-that is, either computer programming or Telecommunications.

<p class="intro">
Currently, I am working on establishing an integrated tourism site for my brother in Ethiopia (<a href="http://www.coolethiopia.com/otherhome">CoolEthiopia</a>) while I am still working on the intercacies on how we are going to manage the Business and how we are going to take in charge of a startup company.

	<h2> Philosophy</h2>
		<p> I try to follow the UNIX philosophy of  <em> KISS</em> as outlined by Eric Raymond, enjoy originally written minimalistic softwares (dia, grep, vi (!emacs), C) but also have developed a taste for integration of various software solutions specifically while working with CMSs. I like to tap into the power of opensource software community but also provide back crashdumps, bug reports and various areas of tasting and providing my system information, participating in forums and do aim to provide tutorials on project files- in the area of latex- that I have worked on and continue to work on.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
     Before encountering content management systems, I have been programming in C, Java, PHP, and even was writing wrappers for SQL queries. Networking is my cup of tea and I will pluck a packet like a chicken. And in the area of Telecommunications, translating lengthy RFCs into codes- mainly using C- and have spent much of my time on the Network Layer. My encounter to CMSs have introduced to providing quick solutions via integration of plugins, practical aspect of SEO and understaning part of the Business logic of applications. In the process, I have come across webhosting solutions providers and their business model. I am also very familiar with both analog and digital circuit design and engineering design lifecycle (cf. SDLC) to create a desired commercial product. 
    quick not separated me from the terminal and vi (and *nix). However, to this day I'm still pretty <em>awesome with Drupal</em> and know my way around Zend Framework, Pylons, and Subversion. <em>Git feels very natural</em> to me and I take advantage of its flexibility daily. Sometimes I <em>configure *nix systems</em> if need arises. I also <em>communicate well</em> in English and Russian.

    <p>For more than <abbr class="duration">2 years</abbr> I <em>studied at <a href="http://unsw.edu.au" class="url summary">University of New South Wales</a></em> (Sydney) pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I abandoned this pursuit a bit past half-way in. However, the courses in Algorithms, Data Structures, Discrete Math, and other <em>fundamental computing-related subjects have taught me a lot</em>.
