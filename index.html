<h2>In Short</h2>
<p class="intro">
<em>As a recent graduate programmer and traditional Telecommunications Engineer, I have been involved with extensive area of developement from kernel-level programming to the application layer</em>. In doing so, I have been previledged to traverse TCP/IP model and the 7-OSI Layers resepectively.
The last year, that is, since I finished my University degree, I have mainly focused on the top layer IP stack both as a form of break from University and Lower level programming; <a href="http://www.coolethiopia.com/otherhome/" >mainly content management systems, databases and general web programming</a>. 
While my visa application is being processed (visa subclass 885), I would want to get a technical assistant position in the areas of my field of expertise-that is, either computer programming or Telecommunications. 
</p>
<!--<p class="intro">  
Currently, I would like to work on the following project: <a href="http://www.coolethiopia.com/otherhome">C-Ethiopia</a>.-->

	<h2> Philosophy</h2>
	<p> I try to follow the UNIX philosophy of  <em> KISS</em> as outlined by Eric Raymond, enjoy originally written minimalistic softwares (dia, grep, vi (!emacs), C) but also have developed a taste for integration of various software solutions specifically while working with CMSs. I like to tap into the power of opensource software community but also provide back crashdumps, bug reports and various areas of testing and providing my system information, participating in forums and do aim to provide tutorials on project files- in the area of latex- that I have worked on and continue to work on.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
    Before encountering content management systems, I have been programming in C, Java, PHP, and even was writing wrappers for SQL queries. And in the area of Telecommunications, networking is my cup of tea and I will pluck a packet like a chicken, translating lengthy RFCs into codes- mainly using C- and have spent much of my time on the Network Layer. My encounter to CMSs have introduced to providing quick solutions via integration of plugins, practical aspect of SEO and understaning part of the Business logic of applications. In the process, I have come across webhosting solutions providers and their business model. I am also very familiar with both analog and digital circuit design and engineering design lifecycle (cf. SDLC) to create a desired commercial product.
    I am firmy grounded on Unix OS terminal and Vi. However, I have to jump to Windows every now and then when the need arises to either <em>use Office </em>. I <em>configure *nix systems</em> when the need arises. I speak Amharic, English and basic skills in both Arabic and German.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>For more than <abbr class="duration">2 years</abbr> I <em>studied at <a href="http://www.dillauniversity.edu.et" class="url summary">Dilla University</a></em> in Ethiopia-which was run down at the time- pursuing a degree in Physics. I abandoned this pursuit a bit past half-way. I then applied to the Univeristy of New South Wales and was offered a place where I <em>graduated as a telecom. engineer</em>. However, most of my time did cross over to the computer sciences field where I studied<em> computer-science related subjects like Database Systems, Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence and in putting effort to translate those courses to the network stack - layer 3 </em>. I have applied most of those skills I have in writing my final year thesis  and wrote a <em> code for a dynamic adaptive multicast firewall filter</em>  which tries to block unwanted users coming into a multicast group they are not invited to (an unintiated user cannot join in a group- along the lines of how the occult groups operate- the firewall allows a new user to come in once they are initiated by an insider). Can a user join two multicast group? what if the two groups are mutually exclusive...these are the questions I still wonder on...can a user join Witchraft group and be a Christian without getting excommunicated by one or are they able in the first place? Well, the initial idea was from Dr. Sivaraman of UNSW. As a student, I was more worried about building it and allowed the user to make that decision- making it fully dynamic- although I have no desire to answer the edge quetions as it can cross over engineering ethics and debates whether privacy should come ahead of secrecy or secrecy ahead...and finally to religious wars.
